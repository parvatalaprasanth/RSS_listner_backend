This case, dare we say, may be one of the wildest rides we’ve brought you along for in quite some time. Charles was really a vibe in the 60’s, at least according to the youths of the day. He would change his appearance quite drastically when he turned 18 and it was at that moment he became a hot commodity. However, he was one of the most evil, callous assholes on the planet. He was responsible for the deaths of three young girls, one being his girlfriend at the time, and some say there’s a fourth victim.

Melinda would tell anyone who would listen that she was going to kill Shanda someday, but for some reason no one took her seriously. One night Melinda gathered a group of friends including: Lauri Tacket, Hope Rippey and Toni Lawrence. The mission was to trick Shanda into thinking Amanda wanted to see her, but Amanda was not there. Three of the four girls then brutally tortured and murdered 12 year old Shanda Sharer, while one did nothing to stop them.

It’s a super cute “labradoodle” and she has had him for 3 weeks now. Like most new dog owners she talked a lot about this dog and how smart he is, how he is with other dogs and people, etc. I didn’t mind of course, if it made her happy then why not!</p> <p>An hour or so into lunch I noticed she kept referring to the dog as “it” and “they” I asked what gender the dog is and she gave me such a look. “…THEY are non-binary. THEY do not have a gender.” Er… what? She really took me surprise and then I laughed thinking she was joking. Well, she wasn’t…</p> <p>I then made the mistake of saying that it’s a bit silly to be that way about her dog. It’s not like the dog can tell her that HE doesn’t identify as a gender.

I’m shocked that she was serious and mad at me over that. I wish I hadn’t laughed and jury kept my mouth shut, I was genuinely just taken by surprise.

Doesn&#39;t matter where you&#39;re from or who you are... I win. The only people who have a chance to beat me are already dead, retired, or not here. The lights go out. Adam Cole&#39;s music hits. He walks out the heel tunnel. The crowd goes wild, despite clearly expecting Daniel Bryan. He comes to the ring. ADAM COLE BAYBAY the crowd cheers. The Elite confront him while the crowd chants HOLY SHIT. He kicks Jungle Boy, who had run to the ring. He hugs the Elite, already a huge scumbag. The Bucks kiss him. In the words of Steve Urkel, kenny says, DID I DO THAT. Who&#39;s ready for story time, Adam says. It&#39;s official, The Elite is the most dominant faction in the history of this business. Ain&#39;t no chance in hell of anyone stopping us. Kenny says he now bids us farewell.... when flight of the Valkyries plays. Bryan Danielson is in AEW. The crowd erupts into YES&#39;s. Excalibur says “WHAT AN INCREDIBLE TIME TO BE ALIVE”. He, Christian and Jurassic Express confront the Elite, and run absolute fucking heavy metal thunder on their shitty faction. It&#39;s wonderful. Bryan kills Nick Jackson. The crowd chants AEW as the show ends. JR says “The game has changed”. </li> </ul> <hr/> <h1>Predictions Contest:</h1> <p><strong>Top 5 Users</strong></p> <p>These are the first five users, sorted by earliest first, who got completely perfect scores on the predictions contest, something which has never happened since I started running these a year ago.</p> <p><a href=\"/u/aholesour\">/u/aholesour</a></p> <p><a href=\"/u/Krak2511\">/u/Krak2511</a></p> <p><a href=\"/u/jdice93\">/u/jdice93</a></p> <p><a href=\"/u/Keksverkaufer\">/u/Keksverkaufer</a></p> <p><a href=\"/u/craigybacha\">/u/craigybacha</a></p> <p>Congratulations to these turbo geniuses, who should be lauded and respected by their peers for never being wrong.</p> <hr/> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SmurfyX\"> /u/SmurfyX </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/\"> r/SquaredCircle </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/pirptu/post_aew_all_out_2021_discussion/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/pirptu/post_aew_all_out_2021_discussion/\">[comments]</a></span>"}

A great effort from the batting unit. It&#39;s my first overseas hundred, so obviously my best one. The three-figure mark wasn&#39;t in my mind, we knew the pressure on the batting unit, but kept our heads down and batted the situation.</p> <p><strong>Virat Kohli</strong> &quot;The character that the side has shown, to come back from 100 run deficit showed that we were not down and out. I said at Lord&#39;s as well, I am proud of the character, among the top three bowling performances I have witnessed as India captain. It&#39;s relative what you call flat, field wasn&#39;t wet like the first three days, ball got scuffed up nicely, one side heavier, and exploited reverse swing perfectly. We believed as a team that we could get all ten wickets.</p> <p><strong>Joe Root</strong> &quot;Frustrating not to get something from the game today, we felt we had an opportunity to win, but credit to India, they got the ball to reverse and that was the turning point. Could have made more of a first-innings lead, and you have to make chances count against world-class players. Got to find ways to get better but be realistic and realise that was world-class bowling. It might reverse at OT, we&#39;ll have to manage it better. Whenever you lose the game you can look at the toss, but we&#39;ve got to be more ruthless, and make that a 200-run lead. Got to be clinical, not be comfy, make big partnerships. We have played good cricket and important to remember that.&quot;</p> <p><a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=poochi&amp;subject=Bot%20Feedback\"><sup>Send feedback</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_schedule\"><sup>Schedule</sup></a> <sup>|</sup> <a href=\"https://np.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/bot_help\"><sup>Stat Help</sup></a></p> <p><sup>Please don&#39;t post illegal streaming links in match threads</sup></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CricketMatchBot\"> /u/CricketMatchBot </a> &#32; to &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/\"> r/Cricket </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/pj1ts7/post_match_thread_india_vs_england_day_5/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/pj1ts7/post_match_thread_india_vs_england_day_5/\">[comments]</a></span>"}
